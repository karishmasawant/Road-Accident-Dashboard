# 🚗 Road‑Accident‑Dashboard‑UK  
*An interactive Tableau project uncovering road‑safety insights across the United Kingdom.*

---

## 📊 Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** built in Tableau using real‑world accident data from the UK Department for Transport (DfT).  
The goal is to turn millions of raw accident‑and‑casualty records into actionable insights that help planners, campaigners, and citizens make Britain’s roads safer.

**What the dashboard delivers**

- **KPI Deck** – headline metrics for total accidents and casualties (fatal, serious, slight) with YoY deltas.  
- **Severity Heatmap** – a UK map coloured by accident severity to pinpoint danger hotspots at a glance.  
- **Vehicle‑Type Breakdown** – shows how cars, HGVs, bikes, and motorcycles contribute to accident counts and casualty severity.  
- **Weather & Road‑Surface Impact** – reveals how rain, snow, fog, and surface conditions (wet, icy, dry) influence crash outcomes.  
- **Interactive Filters** – slice the data by year, severity level, vehicle type, and road type to drill into patterns that matter to you.

By surfacing the *where*, *when*, and *why* behind collisions, the dashboard supports evidence‑based road‑safety policies, targeted infrastructure upgrades, and public awareness campaigns.
